\begin{itemize}
    \item All players share a random string $r$.
    \item $R(f) := E[\abs{C(f)}]$ is the \emph{expected} \# bits communicated.
    \item A randomized communication protocol is allowed to output the wrong answer at most $1/3$ of the time.
\end{itemize}
The ``public coin'' scenario is where you assume $r$ is known ahead-of-time and does not need to be communicated.  The ``private coin'' scenario is where someone computes $r$ and shares it with the other players, so it contributes to the size of the protocol.

It turns out randomized protocols can be much faster, e.g.,
\[C(=) \geq n\]
but
\[\begin{aligned}R(=) & 
    \in \mathcal{O}(\emph{log} \, n) \text{ with a private coin, or } \\
    & \in \mathcal{O}(1) \text{ with a public coin }\end{aligned}\]

The protocol with a private coin turns out to be \textsc{ModCoin}, where
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Alice chooses $\textsc{Coin} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ randomly;
    \item Alice sends $\langle x \text{ mod } \textsc{Coin}, \textsc{Coin} \rangle$ to Bob;
    \item Bob sends $1$ iff $x \text{ mod } \textsc{Coin} = y \text{ mod } \textsc{Coin}$ else $0$, back to Alice.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $x = y$ the protocol is correct with probability 1.
    \item If $x \neq y$ the protocol is correct with probability $P[x \text{ mod } \textsc{Coin} \neq y \text{ mod } \textsc{Coin}]$ which turns out to exceed $1/2$.
\end{itemize}

The protocol with a public coin turns out to be \textsc{Checksum}, which
\begin{itemize}
    \item if $x = y$ is correct with probability 1, and
    \item if $x \neq y$ is correct with probability $1/2$.
\end{itemize}
So if you just do this a second time to confirm $x \neq y$ you get $1/4$ error rate and you are done.
