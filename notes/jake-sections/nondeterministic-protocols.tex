\par{"Nondeterministic communication complexity"}
\\

\par{Defined similarly to NP}
\\

\par{Consider a two party problem (we can generalize to multi-party from here).}
\\

\par{Each player is given their input along with some nondeterministic guess $z$ of length $m$ that may depend on the
given inputs.}
\\

\par{Otherwise the protocol is deterministic.}
\\

\par{$f(x, y) = 1$ iff $\exists z$ that makes the players output 1}
\\

\par{$C(f) = m + communication$}
\\

\par{$NP^{CC}$ is simply nondeterministic communication protocols the have a $C(f) = n^{k}$}

\par{$coNP^{CC}$ is defined similarly}
\\

\par{$g(x, y) = 1 - f(x, y)$}
\\

\par{However it can be shown that: $NP^{CC} \cap coNP^{CC} = P^{CC}$}
\\

\par{This is shown by relating the communication complexities of $f \in NP^{CC}$ and $\overline{f} \in coNP^{CC}$}
\par{$C(f) = k$}
\par{$C(\overline{f}) = 10kl$ for some complexity $l$}
