\par{Thus far, we've dealth exclusively with functions computed via the communication of two parties}
\\

\par{We can generalize this to functions computed by any number of parties}
\\

\textbf{Two Party Setup}
\\

\par{In two party problems, Player 1 knows nothing about Player 2's input, and Player 2 knows nothing about Player 1's
input}
\\

\textbf{Multi-Party Setup}
\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Player i doesn't know its own inut
  \item Player i knows the input of every other player
  \item Messages are broadcasted to each player
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What does this mean?}
\\

\par{Consider a "real-life" example}
\\

\par{We all place a sticky note with some value on our heads. We don't have any knowledge of our own sticky note but
we can see everyone else's.}
\\

\par{Without talking, we must compute some predetermined function via a predetermined protocol. All communication must
be done through the whiteboard in front of us.}
\\

\par{The goal is for one player, after some amount of communication, to write the output of function $f$ on the
whiteboard}
\\

\textbf{Let's look at an example}
\\

\par{$f(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}) = \bigoplus_{i = 1}^{n} maj(x_{1i}, x_{2i}, x_{3i})$}
\\

\par{$f(1101, 1001, 1011) = $}
\par{$\_ \_ \_ \_$}
\par{$1 \_ \_ \_$}
\par{$1 0 \_ \_$}
\par{$1 0 0 \_$}
\par{$1 0 0 1$}
\par{$\bigoplus 1001 = 0$}
\\

\par{$C(\Pi) = 3$}
\\

\par{By the same argument as the two party Parity example, $f$ depends on all three inputs thus the lowest possible
communication complexity is $C(f) = 3$}
\\

\par{By showing that $\Pi$ exists for $f$, $C(f) \geq 3$}
