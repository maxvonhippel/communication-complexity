\begin{itemize}
    \item All players share a random string $r$.
    \item $R(f) := E[\abs{C(f)}]$ is the \emph{expected} \# bits communicated.
    \item A randomized communication protocol is allowed to output the wrong answer at most $1/3$ of the time.
    \item The ``public coin'' scenario is where you assume $r$ is known ahead-of-time and does not need to be communicated.
    \item The ``private coin'' scenario is where someone computes $r$ and shares it with the other players, so it contributes to the size of the protocol.
\end{itemize}
