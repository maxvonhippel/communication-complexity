If we find a protocol $\Pi$,
	then we know $C(f)$ is at most $C(\Pi)$.

What if we don't know any protocol $\Pi$?
\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Could we upper-bound $C(f)$ without knowing $\Pi$?
\end{itemize}

\pause
What if the only protocols we find seem really lousy?
\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Could we lower-bound $C(f)$ without finding a better protocol?
\end{itemize}

\centering{\textbf{TL;DR: yup.}}
