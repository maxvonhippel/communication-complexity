\item The functions $p_i$ can be \emph{anything} so long as they are well-defined.  E.g., could solve the Halting Problem.
\item After the final message, \emph{both parties} must know $f(x, y)$.

\begin{definition}[Communication Complexity]
Suppose $\Pi$ is a protocol for $f$ in which at most $t$
bits are communicated between Alice and Bob.
Then the \emph{communication complexity} of $\Pi$,
	denoted $C(\Pi)$, is $t$.
\end{definition}
\pause
\begin{definition}[$C(f)$]
The communication complexity of $f$, denoted $C(f)$,
	is the minimum communication complexity
	achieved by any protocol for $f$.
