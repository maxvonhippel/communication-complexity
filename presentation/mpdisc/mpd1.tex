\begin{definition}[Multi-Party Discrepency]
Suppose
\[f : \underbrace{\mathbb{B}^n \times ... \times \mathbb{B}^n}_{k \text{ times}} \to \mathbb{B}\]
is a function.  Then the \emph{$k$-party discrepency of $f$} is defined as follows, where $T$ ranges over all cylinder intersections of $f$.
\[\text{Disc}(f) = \frac{1}{(2^n)^k} \max_T \abs{\sum_{(x_1,...,x_k) \in T} f(x_1,...,x_k)}\]
\end{definition}

Man this is really complicated.

Could we lower-bound it statistically?
