\begin{itemize}
\item There are $k$ of us.
\item We all place a sticky note with some value $b \in \mathbb{B}^n$ on our heads. 
\item Without talking, we must compute some predetermined function via a predetermined protocol. All communication must be done through the whiteboard in front of us.
\item The goal is for one player, after some amount of communication, to write the value $f(\text{sticky-note}_1, ..., \text{sticky-note}_k)$ on the whiteboard.
\end{itemize}
