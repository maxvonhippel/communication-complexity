Recall that $\chi(f)$ induces both lower and upper bounds on $C(f)$.
So if any bound on $\chi(f)$ induces a bound on $C(f)$.
We are about to prove the following lower-bound on $\chi(f)$:
\[\begin{aligned}\text{Disc}(A \times B) 
	& = \frac{1}{2^n * 2^n}\abs{\sum_{a \in A, b \in B} (-1)^{M_{a,b}}} \\
	& \leq \chi(f)
\end{aligned}\]
