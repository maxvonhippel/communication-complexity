Now that we've named this thing, let's re-write our inequality.
\[\text{Disc}(A \times B) \geq 1 / K\]
\pause
Taking inverses:
\[\frac{1}{\text{Disc}(A \times B)} \leq K\]
\pause
Certainly $\chi(f) \leq \chi(f)$, so supplanting $\chi(f)$ for $K$ in the statement, we get:
\begin{lemma}[2-Party Discrepency Method]
\[\frac{1}{\text{Disc}(A \times B)} \leq \chi(f)\]
\end{lemma}
