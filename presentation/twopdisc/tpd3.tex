Let's divide both size by $2^n * 2^n$, for fun and profit.
\[\frac{1}{2^n * 2^n}\abs{\sum_{a \in A, b \in B} (-1)^{M_{a,b}}} \geq 1 / K\]

Mathematicians like to name things.
\begin{definition}[Discrepency]
The \textit{discrepency} of a rectangle $A \times B$ of $M(f)$ is exactly the following.
\[\text{Disc}(A \times B) = \frac{1}{2^n * 2^n}\abs{\sum_{a \in A, b \in B} (-1)^{M_{a,b}}}\]
The \emph{discrepency of $M(f)$} is the max disc among its rectangles.
