\textbf{NTS:} If $f$ has a size-$M$ fooling set then $C(f) \geq \text{log}_2(M)$.
\begin{proof}
For a contradiction suppose a protocol $\Pi$ exists for $f$ s.t. $C(\Pi) < \text{log}_2(M)$.
\pause
Then $\Pi$ yields at most $2^{C(\Pi)} < 2^{\text{log}_2(M)} = M$
distinct communication patterns.
\pause
However, there are $M$ input pairs $(x, y)$ that each have distinct communication patterns by definition.
\pause
Since $2^{C(\Pi)} < M$ there must be some $(x, y), (x', y')$ on which $\Pi$ yields the same communication pattern.

\medskip

\pause
Then $(x, y')$ must yield the same communication pattern as $(x, y)$
as Bob cannot possibly tell the difference.  The argument is symmetric for $(x', y)$ and Alice.  One of the two must yield a contradiction and we are done.
\end{proof}
