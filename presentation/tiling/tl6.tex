\textbf{NTS:} $\text{log}_2 \chi(f) \leq C(f)$.
\begin{proof}
Assume $C(f)$. 
\pause
Then $\exists$ a protocol $\Pi$ in which $\leq C(f)$ bits are communicated
between the 2 participants. 
\pause 
For simplicity suppose each bit is communicated individually. 
\pause 
Then $\Pi$ induces a tree whose max depth is $C(f)$, whose leaves form a monochromatic partition of $M(f)$.
\pause  
Every m.c. partition / $M(f)$ requires $\geq \chi(f)$ rectangles, so the tree induced by $\Pi$ has $\geq \chi(f)$ leaves.
\pause  
But it's a binary tree so its depth is at least $\text{log}_2 \chi(f)$.
\end{proof}
