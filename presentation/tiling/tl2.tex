\begin{definition}[Combinatorial Rectangle]
A \emph{combinatorial rectangle} in $M(f)$ is any submatrix of $M$.
We say a rectangle $A \times B$ in $M(f)$ is \emph{monochromatic}
if for all $x, x'$ in $A$ and $y, y'$ in $B$, $M_{x,y} = M_{x',y'}$.
\end{definition}

\underline{Idea:} Each event in a protocol $\Pi$ splits $M(f)$ into two or more
combinatorial rectangles of still-possible values for $f(x, y)$.

\underline{Intuition:} Much like splitting a circuit $C$ into ``$C$ where the first bit is 0'' and ``$C$ where the first bit is 1''.
