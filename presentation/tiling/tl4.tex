Now we get to the punchline.

\begin{definition}[Monochromatic Tiling]
A \emph{monochromatic tiling} of $M(f)$ is a partition of $M(f)$ into disjoint
monochromatic rectangles.

\begin{itemize}
\item Then the leaves of the tree induced by $\Pi$ and rooted at $M(f)$ clearly form a monochromatic tiling of $M(f)$.
\pause
\item The number of leaves in a binary tree can be used to upper-bound its depth.
\pause
\item The depth of the binary tree induced by $\Pi$ is exactly $C(\Pi)$.
