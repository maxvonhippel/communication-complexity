\begin{itemize}
\item Then the leaves of the tree induced by $\Pi$ and rooted at $M(f)$ clearly form a monochromatic tiling of $M(f)$.
\item The number of leaves in a binary tree can be used to upper-bound its depth.
\item The depth of the binary tree induced by $\Pi$ is exactly $C(\Pi)$.

\begin{theorem}[The Punchline]
Let $\chi(f)$ denote the minimum number of rectangles in any monochromatic tiling of $M(f)$.
\[\text{log}_2 \chi(f) \leq
	C(f) \leq
		16 \big( \text{log}_2 \chi(f) \big)^2
\]
