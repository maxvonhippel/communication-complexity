\begin{itemize}
	\item Defined similarly to $\NP$.
	\pause
	\item Consider a two party problem (we can generalize to multi-party from here).  Each player is given their input along with some nondeterministic guess $z$ of length $m$ that may depend on the given inputs.  $C(f) = m + \text{communication}$, and $f(x, y) = 1$ iff $\exists z$ that makes the players output 1.
	\pause
	\item $\NP^{CC}$ is the class of nondeterministic functions $f$ s.t. $C(f) = n^{k}$.  $\coNP^{CC}$ is defined similarly, i.e., $g(x, y) = 1 - f(x, y)$ for $f \in \NP^{CC}$.
	\pause
	\item Claim: $\NP^{CC} \cap \coNP^{CC} = \Pcl^{CC}$.
	This is shown by relating the communication complexities of $f \in \NP^{CC}$ and $\overline{f} \in \coNP^{CC}$.
	\pause
	\item $C(f) = k$, and $C(\overline{f}) = 10kl$ for some complexity $l$.
